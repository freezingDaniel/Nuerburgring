# Nuerburgring Calendar
Here you find an ICS-file with the calendar of the 'Ring

## How often is it updated:
The Program pulls/reads the schedule from https://nuerburgring.de/open-hours every 4 hours, so it's not guaranteed to always be fully up-to-date on shortterm changes.
It's rather meant to offer a quick glance at the forecasted schedule. It does make sense to check the official site if you plan to go, just to be sure.

## How to add the calendar:
Add the ics to you calendar using:
- https://github.com/freezingDaniel/Nuerburgring/releases/download/latest/Tourist-Drives-Nordschleife.ics
- https://github.com/freezingDaniel/Nuerburgring/releases/download/latest/Tourist-Drives-Grand-Prix-Track.ics

By downloading and importing you'll have a snapshot of the time you downloaded, so instead add a subscription to the links in your calendar app
